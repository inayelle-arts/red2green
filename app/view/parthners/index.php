            Thanks to our partners in the face of RedGalaxy, the largest Martian spaceport and a
            multitude of earthly airlines and ground transport companies, you can visit not only
            more than two and a half million earthly cities, but also amazing wildlife spots.
            Our partner airlines on Earth guarantee the safety and comfort of your travels around
            the blue planet, and personalized capsules with modern space suits will ensure you a
            safe stay in conditions of an unfamiliar planet.
            In addition, our company cooperates with many networks of hotels and restaurants on
            Earth, so you do not need to look for a place to stay in the visited countries by
            yourself.
            Throughout the journey, our clients have a unique medical insurance that guarantees
            medical care in specialized hospitals for Martians on Earth.
            You can find out more about the conditions of interplanetary travels on the official
            RedGalaxy website.
